## Description of the project

This repo is especially made for those who, for any reason, want to allow users to input basic Math expressions in Java apps and quickly solve them during runtime (like, for example, when building a basic calculator). For that, there are two powerful and simple algorithms available to quickly solve Math expressions and you simply have to pick one of them based on your use case.

The first algorithm available is the [Shunting Yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm), used to quickly parse and solve Math expressions written in the notation we commonly use to write Math expressions; also known as [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation). This means that you can use this library to solve statements like, for example:

- ((25\*3-9)/(4+2)+5^3)-(48/8)\*(7+2)+14 (which is equals to 96)
- 2 \* 3 + 5 \* 2^3 (which is equals to 46)
- 3 + 4 * 2 / (1 - 5)^2^3 (which is equals to 3.000122070313)
- (8^2 + 15 *4 - 7) / (3 + 5)*(12 - 9) + 6^2 - (18 /3) + 11 (which is equals to 84.875)

The second algorithm available when using this library is the [Reverse Polish Notation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation); which can be used to parse and solve expressions written using the [postfix or Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation). This makes possible to obtain the result of solving statements like:

- 3 4 2 * 1 5 - 2 3 ^ / + + (which is equals to 10.5)
- 10 2 ^ 3 4 * + 6 2 / 1 - ^ (which is equals to 12544)
- 29 3 / 2 4 * + 1 45 - 26 ^ + (which is equals to 5.367469541424E42)
- 78 200 3 * + 47 5 ^ 2 / - 6 + (which is equals to -114671819.5)

Any of the described methods include support for numbers written using a variant of the [Scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation) named [E notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation); and to help you see which operators are supported by each of the previously described methods, here's a table including them.

| Algorithm | ( | ) | + | - | * or ร | / or รท | ^ |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Shunting Yard | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Reverse Polish Notation | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

> [!TIP]
>
> Any other operator not included in the previous table is currently not supported and using any operator not included there will cause an exception.

## Getting the library

### Building the library locally

To build the library locally, the first thing you must do is to make sure that you have a valid installation of the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit). That can be easily checked by executing the following command in a terminal:

```bash
java --version
```

> [!TIP]
>
> The minimum Java version required to build this library is [Java 8](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_8).

If the execution of that command generates any output instead of an error message, then your installation of the JDK should be correct; and after effectively checking the JDK installation, you must create a local copy of this repo in your device. In order to do that, launch a terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jr20xx/JCalc
```

Once the execution of that command is finished, a new directory containing a copy of the files of this project will be created. You can open that folder with a Java IDE with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) support like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) installed) and then build the library making use of their integrated tools. If you need help doing that, you can check [this website](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_ides.html) to get references of how to do that in your preferred IDE.

If you decide to build the library without using any IDE, then open the newly created directory containing the files from this repo and start a terminal session from there. Once you've opened a terminal, run any of the following commands:

*From Linux terminal:*

```bash
./gradlew build
```

*From Windows command line:*

```bash
gradlew.bat build
```

Once the execution of that command is done, open the `jcalc` directory, then open the `builds` directory and, once you are watching its content, you'll see a folder named `libs`. In that last folder you'll find compiled files of the library, the [Javadocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) and the source code compressed as single JAR files that you can use as you wish.

### Getting the library from JitPack

To ease the process of getting a compiled version of the library that you can use directly in your projects, you can use JitPack. In order to do that, follow the official guide [provided here](https://jitpack.io/#jr20xx/JCalc) by JitPack.

## Usage

### Basic usage

To make use of this library, the first thing you need to decide is which is going to be the solving method that you've planned to use when solving Math expressions. After that, you have to set that method making use of the `JCalc.with(...)` function and, immediately after that, you have to invoke the `.solve(...)` method passing two parameters to it. The first parameter you must pass is a String containing the Math expression that you want to get solved while the second parameter is a boolean value used to specify when to automatically attempt to balance the parentheses in the given Math expression. When called, that method will return another String with the result of solving the given Math expression. If the given expression is empty or contains only whitespaces, `null` will be returned instead of any result. Besides that, when using the Reverse Polish Notation algorithm as the solving method, the value of the second parameter will be completely ignored.

Here's a clear code example for you to get an idea of how to work with the library and to allow you to know which one is the method that must be called to get the work done:

```java
String expression = "3 + 4 * 2 / (1 - 5)^2^3";
String result = JCalc.with(SolvingMethod.ShuntingYardAlgorithm).solve(expression, true);
System.out.print(result); // Prints "3.000122070313"
```

### Exceptions handling

This library contains a small set of custom exceptions that should be controlled to guarantee that the execution of the program doesn't get interrupted or glitched. Here's a Java snippet showing all of them with added comments explaining when they are expected to happen:

```java
try {
    String expression = "2 * 3 + 5 * 2^3)";
    String result = JCalc.with(SolvingMethod.ShuntingYardAlgorithm).solve(expression, true);
}
catch (UnbalancedParenthesesException exception) {
    // This exception occurs when the Shunting Yard algorithm was selected as the solving method, parentheses were not placed correctly and `false` is provided as second parameter
}
catch (NotNumericResultException exception) {
    // This exception occurs when a not numeric (NaN) value is obtained
}
catch (InfiniteResultException exception) {
    // This exception occurs when an Infinite result is obtained
}
catch (SyntaxErrorException exception) {
    // This exception occurs when an error is detected in the writing of the Math expression
}
catch (Exception exception) {
    // This is recommended in case that an unexpected exception arises
}
```

## About the docs

The code included in this library includes [Javadocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) comments nearly everywhere and the rest of the code will be documented in the same way soon. Thanks to JitPack, you can read the online version of the Javadocs by visiting [this website](https://jitpack.io/com/github/jr20xx/JCalc/latest/javadoc/).
